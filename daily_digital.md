### Assignment
  * title **daily_digital**
  * Go out in the world, and find a piece of current tech news
  * In a markdown document, provide the following information about your news:
    - source(s)
    - brief description
      - cover the major points, imagine you were going to lead a ~5min discussion on this, what should you cover to do so
    - why did you select this story?
  * In addition to your news and writeup, provide 3 websites that you would send students to in order to find good tech news.

[This article](https://www.wired.com/story/ukraine-video-games-guilt/), a *Wired* column by a Ukrainian writer, Vlad Ned, provides an interesting perspective on the way that mobile phones and games have come to dominate our lives. After fleeing his apartment in Kyiv, and sending his wife and children abroad for their safety, Ned finds himself eager to escape from the bombings, air raid sirens, and constant drumbeat of brutality around him--through video games--but also finds himself consumed by guilt at his desire to travel to another world, thanks to video games. This isn't "news", exactly, in the sense of a breaking story, or technological development, but raises important questions about the role video games--and other forms of technology that can delight and distract us--play in our lives.

I think my students would be extremely keen to discuss this article, since it ties into their own questions about why their parents and teachers tell them to play video games less often, when they recognize that there is *something* inherently valuable in the playing of games, even if they can't always articulate it. In this instance, students are also closely following the war in Ukraine; I think this article might serve as the backbone for something larger, like a Socratic Seminar on the value of video games. (If I were to do a ~5 min discussion, I would probably ask students to read the text for homework, then play the game **Save The Last Word**, where students gather in groups of 3-5, and have each member share a quote that spoke to them, at which point the other group members debate *why* they think their peer chose that particular quote.)

This story, to me, raises a lot of interesting philosophical questions:
+ What is the point of video games?
+ What is the purpose of technology? (In this column, we see technology serving as a form of distraction, but also escape in a positive sense--the writer describes how the only thing preventing his wife from doomscrolling on Twitter was playing *Stardew Valley*.)
+ How do we play games responsibly? Do we have a responsibility to ignore "distractions" like video games, so we can deal with our world's pressing issues, or are video games necessary to help us recover *from* trying to deal with the world's pressing issues?

In a sense, this article touches on the larger issue of games, from a philosophical point of view, which connects to [the post](https://hunterteacher-vyz6159.slack.com/archives/C02V5MVHB1N/p1647824467023679) I made for our topics class on Alpha Go, the game-solving AI that was used to defeat Lee Sedol, then the world's top Go player, in 2016.

If I were to ask students to find more tech news, I would suggest they read any of the following sites:
+ [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com) - A great source for articles on tech topics that aren't just headlines (like the column described above; another recent feature recounts the history of the seemingly universal "hup" sound to indicate jumping in video games.)
+ [The New York Times Technology section](https://www.nytimes.com/section/technology) - Generally, in my experience, the best place to go for breaking news about tech (unless you're a Twitter person, although any headlines you see on Twitter will likely be fleshed out in an article here before too long!)
+ [The Ezra Klein Show](https://www.nytimes.com/column/ezra-klein-podcast) - This NYT podcast covers lots of topics, but AI and other tech topics are certainly in the mix! The interviews are extremely thoughtful, and the way the topics bounce around drives home that tech news isn't just about tech--as was noted in class, bitcoin is also a climate issue, due to the heavy energy consumption involved in "mining" coins by using computer servers that cost gargantuan amounts of electricity.
