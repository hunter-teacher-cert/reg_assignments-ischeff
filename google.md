### Assignment
* title **google**
* Create or use an existing programming task in a programming language of a class you are teaching (or would like to teach).
  - The task should involve multiple steps, ~5.
* Run a few internet searches that a student might run when presented with your task.
* In a markdown file:
  - Describe the task
  - For each search you ran provide three links from the results
    - Provide a critique on the result. Things to consider:
      - Was it useful?
      - Was it too simple/complex?
      - Was it unecessarily compicated?
      - Did it include copypastable code?
      - Did you learn from it/could a student learn from it?


  The assignment I'd like to use is the AP Exam app for APCSP, which my students are just finishing. ([You can read the task directions here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/pdf/ap-csp-student-task-directions.pdf), but it basically boils down to: create a program that takes input and output, uses a collection type such as a list to store data, and then uses a loop of some kind and a conditional statement to manipulate the data en route to producing output.)

  If I were to google this, imagining I were a student, I would probably first look for other examples of successful programs, since this task is given nationally each year.

  If you Google like "AP CSP Create Task Examples", videos pop up that are made by teachers and students, walking through examples of programs that successfully meet the project criteria. Here are some examples:

  + [Link 1 - a teacher-led video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TzPiFs1_YM)
  + [Link 2 - another teacher-led video example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFTbPkAoClQ)
  + [Link 3 - a playlist of student examples](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNuSvVYffcZD5aDn7M69_eE9BkyjoMttt)

  On the one hand, these videos would provide a great deal of guidance for anyone who had no idea where to start, and who found the resources I provided in class (like samples created by me and past students) unhelpful, or not helpful enough. The teacher-led videos are, in general, quite explicit, and not unmanageably long, given that the task involves quite a few steps, and each video is roughly 30 min long at most. The student videos likewise provide a great number of examples of how *different* your program can be while still meeting the requirements.

  However, the student sample videos are generally not explained well, if at all--they just show the program running. (You can see students asking in the comments section to see the code!). Of course, in some ways, this is actually *helpful* because then students can't copy and paste the code!

  All in all, I think curating a library of videos like this is probably the best choice, so that you can ensure that the videos are well explained. (I wouldn't want a student happening upon just the example videos and getting confused or discouraged.)
