  * title: **think_different.md**
  * Describe 3 different strategies for implementing differentiation in a CS class.
  * Things to consider
    - What are you differentiating for (ability, interest, learning style preference...)?
    - Are students being grouped? If so, how?
    - What is the goal of differentiation for this specific strategy?

  As we discussed in class this week, there are really three main ways to differentiate instruction: by presentation, by process, and by product. In CS, almost any assignment can easily be differentiated by product, since you can show mastery of the same concept in different ways. For instance, when we had students make their first apps this year in APCSP (using code.org), they could create apps that served any informational purpose, so long as one could navigate from one page to another--some students made apps about queer-inclusive sexual health and wellness, while others provided information about NFL teams.
