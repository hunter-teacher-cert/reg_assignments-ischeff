### Assignment
  * title: **grading_schema.md**
  * Look at the python lab files here: https://github.com/hunter-teacher-cert/spring-2021-methods-2/tree/main/resources
  * Pick a lab, and create a grading schema for it. Assume you can assign any kind of grade you want.

The lab I chose is the csv lab, in which students are introduced to csv files through looking at historical population data for NYC. Following the model of the case study I described in the async channel, on heaps, which uses "competence-based grading", I think a similar schema would work well here, since there are multiple problems in sequence, which build on each other. To demonstrate the maximum competence, you need to accomplish all of the tasks.

Hence, I propose porting over the schema from that case study, in which students are not graded using points, but by dividing the lab into three chunks: work that demonstrates **awareness**, **understanding**, and **competence**.

I would divide the lab up this way:

+ To demonstrate an awareness of these topics, you must:
    Successfully solve problems 0-1
+ To demonstrate an understanding of these topics, you must:
    Successfully solve problems 0-4
+ To demonstrate competence of these topics, you must:
    Successfully solve problems 0-6

Since understanding the later problems requires understanding the earlier problems (since the problems build on each other), this would neatly fit the structure of the lab.
