## Final project

### Topic:
Parameters

### Standard(s):
9-12.CT.4
Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

### Aim:
How can we use dance to model how parameters work?

---

### Do Now:
What metaphor might you use to explain how parameters work?
*The goal here is to elicit what students remember about parameters!*

Student-created metaphors should:
+ allow for parameters to change value (since they're variables)
+ incorporate a stand-in for arguments
+ include, somehow, the idea that parameters take in input, to pass to a function, where they serve some goal.

*An example might be the game of pass the hot potato, where the potato is an argument passed between multiple functions (i.e., people)*
