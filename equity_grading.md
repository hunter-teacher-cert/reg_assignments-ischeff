  * title: **equity_grading.md**
  * Listen to the following podcast on grading (35 minutes): https://sites.duke.edu/csedpodcast/2021/02/15/season-2-episode-4-grading-for-equity/
  * In a markdown document, provide your reaction to the suggestions made in the episode.
    - Do you agree with the general sentiment or not?
    - Do yo have specific points of agreemnt/disagreement?
  * For those of you currently teaching: Do you think that you would be able to implement some of these ideas in your class? If not, what would keep you from doing so?

  This author's book was required reading at my school last summer. (Or at least an excerpt of his work.)
  I both agree and disagree with his ideas. On the one hand, it seems sensible that grades
  should only reflect your performance--how much you know and are able to do.

  But, at the same time, in the workplace, this is almost never the case--deadlines matter.

  For another, having seen this play out at our school, I think it has to go hand in hand with mastery based grading.
  From my personal experience, it feels like an odd fit to have assignments and quizzes, and to have some of the policies discussed here in place, but not to grade in terms of mastery on standards alone. (We have three categories this year--engagement, formative assessments, and summative assessments.)

  For another, there has been no appreciable change in the homework turn-in rates in my classes / at our school,
  so far as I can tell. The author avers that students will do the work, but I think a larger question for student motivation is not how you are graded but whether you think what you are learning is worthwhile--in the vast majority of cases, with classes conditioned by standardized assessments that our students have no say in, I would hazard the answer is no, and so there is little incentive to do the homework beyond the grade.

  An interesting point is that so many students have been conditioned for so long to think of grades in one way
  that a change like this is difficult to communicate. I haven't graded homework all year, but many of my students
  didn't realize until we discussed it this week that their homework was not graded. (One student said he wondered why he hadn't failed his math class yet.)

  One idea I really like from this author is not giving zeroes. It makes the math much more equitable when you put in a 55 instead of a 0 if you are on a 0-100 grading scale.
